Name- Sneha Kumari

I want to be a part of this club because I want to start my journey in CyberSecurity with proper guidance and to work in field in the near future.
This club also aligns with my branch CyberSecurity and will definetly prove to be helpful to me in the longer run.
I am eager to learn about ethical hacking, security tools, and real-world threats and to participate in workshops and team projects to improve myself.

A well-known cybersecurity incident is when Facebook user data was leaked online. Personal details like phone numbers and profile information of millions of users were exposed. It showed how important it is for companies to protect user data and improve their security systems.
